#### Project Objective
- - - -
Securely look after whatâ€™s important using E2EE. Configurable, multi-device, encrypted messaging alerts (Matrix/Signal). Powerful, transparent, effective & non-invasive. 

We were tired of all the security apps out there either collecting user data or simply not working. When the app has one job, get it done and do it well. 

#### Phena what?
Phena (from Phenakite, the gemstone attributed to higher awareness) uses AI & machine learning coupled with phone sensors to guard the safety of individuals and their property. Cross platform deployment, native codebase.

### What comes next?
- - - -
Alpha build coming soon: iOS rollouts happen prior to Android in some cases. TestFlight will be available soon along with weekly/nightly builds. 

Accepting feature requests and making them happen: this app is for you, not me alone. Your input is valuable, what would you like to see?
